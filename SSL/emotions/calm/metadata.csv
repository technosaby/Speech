Calm-1.wav | I bet that is really neat!

Calm-9.wav | Well a species isn't extinct until that last individual dies, so I think parrots as a whole have a ways to go until they are extinct. I'm sure there a few specific parrots that are close to extinction due to habitat loss though.

Calm-18.wav | I wonder, do they always run during a full moon? I can't remember if it was full last year. Do you remember?
Calm-19.wav | you were fine during the phone call from Marge, dinner was okay, doing the dishes was fine.
Calm-20.wav | But the pennies always get you because you end up spending like, you know, fifty bucks.
Calm-21.wav | We're getting ready for the fall apple picking here in Missouri.

Calm-28.wav | You can't read her mind.

Calm-31.wav | for such an inconvenience and your bag, but
Calm-32.wav | Well, I'm moving up. I mean it could be...
Calm-33.wav | Well so what?
Calm-34.wav | Yeah there are early prototype models that go back to the late  one  nineth century though. Those were motorcycles.
Calm-35.wav | Do you want some brandy?
Calm-36.wav | What are some of the techs?
Calm-37.wav | my sister works at a soup kitchen. she serves poor people free food
Calm-38.wav | There's like mystery here, there's magic. It's like a little bit of the unexplainable. I just can't see how you're not interested.
Calm-39.wav | Twenty one hundred?
Calm-40.wav | I'll make a a heat retention yarn to make sweaters or a water resistant yarn to make boot socks for my kids.
Calm-41.wav | i feel you! I don't drive at night, i make my hubby drive ) The cause of astigmatism is still unclear!
Calm-42.wav | It's good, you know. you know It hurts I know. I know what it's like to lose someone like that.

Calm-56.wav | It just seems so silly to go on and on and on with such a thing.
Calm-57.wav | From her point of view why else would I come?
Calm-58.wav | You put things in such an interesting and accessible way. I love the phrasing of thinking of corn dogs and taret tots as superhero companions. It's a great way to think.
Calm-59.wav | The chicken nugget is made of that pink slime though.
Calm-60.wav | I think it's usually pizza dough but I've seen a big cookie with fruit toppings or candy, and frosting for sauce P
Calm-61.wav | That's the woman's job to lure the man. Watch me a moment won't you?
